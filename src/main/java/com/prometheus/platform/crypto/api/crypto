Cryptographic services:
Data Confidentiality - makes the data unreadable for non-related parties
Integrity            - makes sure that the data has not been changed in its transmission
Authenticity         - makes sure that the data has been sent from the right person or by you,
                       only the receiver can authenticate this message.
Non-Repudiation      - makes sure that the data has been sent from exactly one person,
                       everyone can authenticate a non-repudiation message.


Cryptographic services are provided by different cryptographic primities:
Encryption
Hash functions
Message Authentication Code (MAC)
Digital signature

Encryption algorithms are divided into
Symmetric key algorithms - require a single private key
Asymmetric key algorithms - require a public and a private key pair


ENCRYPTION
Encryption is done by Ciphers. Block ciphers process data by fixed size blocks.
Most popular ciphers include
Data Encryption Standard - DES (symmetric)
Advanced Encryption Standard - AES (symmetric)
Rivest–Shamir–Adleman - RSA (asymmetric)

Symmetric key ciphers require Initialization Vector (IV)

These ciphers operate on with various Modes of Operations:
An initialization vector (IV) or starting variable (SV)[5] is a block of bits
that is used by several modes to randomize the encryption and hence to produce
distinct ciphertexts even if the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times,
without the need for a slower re-keying process.
Electronic Codebook - ECB
Cipher Block Chaining - CBC

and Paddings (adding data to the beginning, middle, or end of a message prior to encryption)
PKCS5Padding
NoPadding


HASH FUNCTIONS
Hash functions implement message digestions. Common message digestion algorithms
MD5 - widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value, used for checksums
SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 - standard and most secure message digest algorithms

MAC
keyed-hash message authentication code or hash-based message authentication code - HMAC
involves using cryptographic hash functions:
MD5, SHA1, SHA256 combined into HmacMD5, HmacSHA1, HmacSHA256



DIGITAL SIGNATURE
Digital Signature Algorithm - DSA
combined with SHA1
or RSA combined with SHA1 or SHA256
